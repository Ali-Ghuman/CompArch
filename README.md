# CompArch


So far, I made it take in two strings and print out both of them

it still kind of bugs out when its too big though

I was thinking we pass in %13s for the scan pattern, 
so that it cuts off after 13 input chars. We can check that
and know if its too large

Make file works, use command "make all" and then run ./a.out
