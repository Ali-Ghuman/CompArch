Overview 
For project #1, you will ask the user to input 2 strings and concatenate the two. Both strings will have at most 12 ASCII characters. You will ask the user to enter the first string after which they will hit enter. If the number of characters exceeds the 12-character limit, you will print an error and exit the program with a 7 return code. If the number of characters is less than or equal to 12 characters, you will ask them to enter another string. If the second string exceeds the character limit, your program should print an error message and exit with an 8 return code.

If both strings meet the requirements, you will then output the concatenated string to stdout and return an error code that consists of the total number of characters in the concatenated string.

Deliverables/Grade Breakdown
The following deliverables will be required:
1.	Design Document (65%)
a.	This document will contain sections containing: 
i.	The requirements set above
ii.	The overall architecture of your program. For example, what were some appropriate functions that you needed to code and why did you decide on these particular functions?
iii.	The challenges that you faced and how you overcame them. For example, while the majority of the program is expected to be in assembly, you should leverage existing C std library functions. Your document will describe what functions you chose and why.
iv.	A README explaining how to build and execute your program
2.	Separate code listing (25%)
a.	The source code itself will be separate from your design document 
b.	The source code must successfully build using the instructions in the README of your design document on the uLab server. Points will be deducted if I need to deviate from your instructions to get your source to build.
3.	Execution (10%)
a.	The program must execute against my test cases. Points will be deducted if your application doesn't return the expected results, 

Project #1 is due March 11 at 9pm.
